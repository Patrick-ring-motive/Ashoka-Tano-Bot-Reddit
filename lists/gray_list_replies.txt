you just gave me an idea. you're a jedi, which gives you special clearance.:Right.
and jedi are allowed to travel to neutral worlds like mandalore, where we could then board a cargo ship to a separatist system.:Are you suggesting I use my status as a Jedi, to smuggle you behind enemy lines?
it's just that you could get us through to meet with her, and I haven't seen her or her family, in so long.:I'll help you.
far too often, we forget that our most important allies are not always the most powerful.:Master Whystalker said you should teach me about politics.
right.:You know, you two have more in common than you think. It’s no wonder you get along so well.
thanks for the suggestion:So, if you’re a captain and I’m a Jedi, then, technically, I outrank you, right?
in my book, experience outranks everything.:Well, if experience outranks everything, I guess I better start getting some.
well, i've known no other way. gives us clones all a mixed feeling about the war. many people wish it never happened. But without it, we clones wouldn't exist.:Well, then perhaps some good has come from all of it. The Republic couldn't have asked for better soldiers, nor I a better friend.
i honor my code. that's what i believe.:TRex? Are you okay?
yeah. yeah, kid. i'm okay. i'm sorry for what happened earlier. i almost killed you.:How widespread is this?
so what do we do? fight our way to the shuttle?:They’re too many. Besides, I don’t wanna hurt them.
i hate to tell you this, but they don’t care. This ship is going down, and those soldiers, my brothers, are willing to die and take you and me along with them.:You’re a good soldier, TRex. So is every one of those men down there. They may be willing to die, but I am not the one who is going to kill them.
